IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

AIM -  Your objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species. 

TECHNOLOGIES -

a.Pandas: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It is used to read the IRIS dataset from a CSV file and handle the dataset throughout the code, including displaying the first few rows and checking for missing values.

b.Scikit-learn (sklearn): A widely used machine learning library in Python. The following components from Scikit-learn are utilized in your code:

1.train_test_split: A function that splits the dataset into training and testing sets, ensuring that you can evaluate the model on unseen data.

2.RandomForestClassifier: A machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It is trained to predict the species of the Iris flowers based on their features.

3.classification_report and accuracy_score: Functions that evaluate the performance of the model. The classification report provides detailed metrics, while the accuracy score gives a simple measure of performance.

d.Machine Learning: The code demonstrates a typical workflow for a multiclass classification task, specifically predicting the species of Iris flowers based on features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

e.Data Preprocessing: The code prepares the features (X) and target variable (y) by dropping the species column from the features dataset and separating the target variable for training and evaluation.

f.Model Training and Evaluation: The code trains a Random Forest model on the training data, makes predictions on the test data, and evaluates the model using a classification report and accuracy score.
